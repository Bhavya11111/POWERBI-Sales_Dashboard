# 📊 Power BI Sales Dashboard

Welcome to my Power BI Sales Dashboard project!  
This dashboard was built to explore and understand sales performance in a clear, visual, and interactive way.

## 🌟 What This Dashboard Shows

This dashboard lets you dive into:
- **Total Sales, Profit, and Quantity Sold** over time
- **Top-performing products and regions**
- **Monthly sales trends and seasonal patterns**
- **Quick filters** to view sales by Year, Product, Region, or Customer Segment

It's designed for anyone who wants to get a quick and meaningful understanding of how their sales are doing — whether you're part of a sales team, business analyst, or just curious.

## 🎯 Why I Created This

I built this dashboard to practice data modeling, visualization, and storytelling using Power BI.
